# Perceptron-Model-from-Scracth
In this project, we have implemented the classic Perceptron for binary classification (0/1 class labels). Invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, a perceptron is the simplest neural network possible: a computational model of a single neuron. A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output.
